Between 1979 and 1984 I was a member of the Oxford Printmakers Cooperative. You see here a mixture of screenprints, etchings and woodcuts. Some of the images are constructed from photographs but others are hand drawn into wax before being etched. Some aquatint is also used in those prints.

The woodcuts that you see here are hand printed onto Japanese paper using a hand burin. These woodcuts use shaped pieces accurately cut with on bandsaw.
