## Getting XML of the play into InDesign

**find** the template *play.indt* from the downloaded resources

- Start a new InDesign file by opening this file (double click)
- Save as your play
- See the structure panel on the left

**Look at the DTD**

These tags match the style names (paragraph and character names)

### Import XML

From the context menu find _import XML_
Find your play from the folder _text_of_plays_
Import

Now see the play in the structure pane

### Put the XML on the page

- Drag the dramatis personae onto the first page
- Now drag the play onto the third page

#### map the tags with the styles

From the context menu on the structure pane see the menu item _Map tags to Styles_
**Note: Do not use the reverse of this**

**Map by name**

We will get a blank extra page at the beginning. This is because the style for the Dramatis heading is designed to start on a new page and there is already an empty paragraph on the first page. Just find the *pilchrow* on page one and delete this.
