### Put the XML on the page

- Drag the dramatis personae onto the first page
- Now drag the play onto the third page

#### map the tags with the styles

From the context menu on the structure pane see the menu item _Map tags to Styles_
**Note: Do not use the reverse of this**

Map by name

For each section a new page is started. This is because the style for the Dramatis heading and the Act heading are designed to start on a new page. Just find the pilchrow on page one and delete this.
