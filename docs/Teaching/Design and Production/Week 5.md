### What is Typography?

#### Typefaces vs. Fonts: Difference?

A lot of people use the terms “typeface” and “font” interchangeably. But they’re two very distinct things. Before we get started talking about typography, let’s get our terms straight.

A typeface is a set of typographical symbols and characters. It’s the letters, numbers, and other characters that let us put words on paper (or screen). A font, on the other hand, is traditionally defined as a complete character set within a typeface, often of a particular size and style. Fonts are also specific computer files that contain all the characters and glyphs within a typeface.

Several types of fonts are;

- Old style serif
- Transitional serif
- Square sans-serif
- Geometric sans-serif
- Formal script
- Casual script

When most of us talk about “fonts”, we’re really talking about typefaces, or type families (which are groups of typefaces with related designs).
