This week we need to add the frontmatter pages. 

## The new pages needed:

A page that starts the book. This will be a landscape page that can be a version of the cover, with the title and subtitle and image.

Then we need the imprint or copyright information. You can split this page into 2 with the imprint on the left and the table of contents on the right.

![This is what you need](../../media/flatplanFBK.jpg)

When constructing the start page, keep the elements separate so that we can make this page deliver dynamically with a build up.

>  More details on the Table of contents is available here although the examples given are for a portrait shaped book.
