This week is to cover the basics of `HTML` and `CSS`.
We have covered this before in _Typographic Design for Page and Screen_, but I am very much going to go through the basics using **vscode**

First we need to get a copy of vscode

- Install vscode

* Put the vscode icon on the dock

get this extension for vscode:

* Liveserver

Download the folder to try out styling one recipe. This is on moodle.
