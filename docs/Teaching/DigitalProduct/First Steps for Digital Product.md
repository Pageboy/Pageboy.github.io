## Introduction

1. You will learn how to style your own web site by creating a recipe web site with at least 5 recipes.
2. You will take these five recipes and create an enhanced eBook

## Think of a theme for your recipe product

You need to choose 5 or more recipes by theme, so that you can create a web site and a Recipe eBook. You need to find some logical reason to build this small collection. Examples might be:

- Favourite recipes from Scotland
- Seaside Recipes
- Pies and Pastries
- 5 Pasta Recipes from Italy
- Recipes from the Victorian Kitchen
- 5 Puddings

Suggest some recipe book titles that include 5 simple recipes

You need to decide on a title (with an optional sub-title) and write an introduction (about 150 words) of the contents. The recipes can be from anywhere, or your own. You will work the title into an ebook cover (the second assignment) and the introduction and the image of the cover will go onto the web site. 

The theme is most important. You can think of a title for your product at the same time.

- The recipes should be in the public domain
- the images that you use should also be in the public domain or using a Creative Commons attribution licence

### Collect the recipes 
use any note or word processor to keep them somewhere. You can copy / paste from web sites.
There are a lot of links to web sites on moodle

## The web site
This will be hosted and be a live site.

For the following processes I suggest that you use *Google Chrome* rather than *Apple Safari*

- Create a free account on GitHub.com (You may already have an account)

Create a new repository from this template

Once logged in go to this site in another tab: https://github.com/Pageboy/student_recipes

see the green button `Use this template` Hit that and `Create a new repository`

You will need to name this repository. Remember what you called it

make sure you make this *Public*

You should now have a repository built on this template. You can leave this site open for moment . Your site assets are stored here but the site will be built from these files at **Netlify**.

## Netlify

Go to [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com) You donâ€™t need to create an account; you just sign in through your GitHub account. 

Create a site from the repository



### Some GitHub settings

https://api.netlify.com/auth/done


## HTML and CSS

right now your site doesn't have any styling at all so we need to take a copy of one of  your recipes and  go through a number of exercises to edit the stylesheet.

Find the program call *SiteSucker* (you can download a copy from moodle)

Paste in the URL box your live web site. This will be something like **myrecipes.netlify.app**

Press return.

Your complete web site will be saved in the downloads folder under the name *us.sitesucker.mac.sitesucker*. In that folder will be your site named as the url of your site. Move this folder out of the downloads folder and into your project space for your work (maybe in a Google Drive folder)
