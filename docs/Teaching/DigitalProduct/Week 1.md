## Introduction

1. You will learn how to style your own web site by creating a recipe web site with at least 5 recipes.
2. You will take these five recipes and create an enhanced eBook

## Think of a theme for your recipe product

You need to choose 5 or more recipes by theme, so that you can create a web site and a Recipe eBook. You need to find some logical reason to build this small collection. Examples might be:

- Favourite recipes from Scotland
- Seaside Recipes
- Pies and Pastries
- 5 Pasta Recipes from Italy
- Recipes from the Victorian Kitchen
- 5 Puddings

> Lots of web sites with recipes are here. [[Open Source Recipes]]

You need to decide on a title (with an optional sub-title) and write an introduction (about 150 words) of the contents. The recipes can be from anywhere, or your own. You will work the title into an ebook cover (the second assignment) and the introduction and the image of the cover will go onto the web site. 

The theme is most important. You can think of a title for your product at the same time.

- The recipes should be in the public domain
- the images that you use should also be in the public domain or using a Creative Commons attribution licence

### Collect the recipes 
use any note or word processor to keep them somewhere. You can copy / paste from web sites.
There are a lot of links to web sites on moodle

## The web site
