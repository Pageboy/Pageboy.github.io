Some issues that you might encounter:

- If you have used a background image on your web site, this will show up in the initial saved document from Google Chrome. This will not show up in InDesign when you place the Word file.
	- However, if you want to use the image in the eBook, you can place this separately.
- You may have some missing fonts if you used fancy ways on the web site to add typefaces - through Google fonts for example.
- large images are not displaying and text is overset.

The last issue here can be identified by viewing the text with Story Editor.

To solve the problem we can search for the graphic objects and apply an existing object style (one exists in the template but you can create one also).

## Images are embedded

When you place the Word documents into InDesign the images will be embedded and we need to _un-embed_ them. 

You will find the links panel under Window>Links. The images will need to be saved somewhere in your project space. Here are the steps to take.

Right-click over the image in the links panel.

Make sure you have these images in your project space.

## Designing your pages

You are entirely free to re-organise the content within InDesign. Images will initially be anchored, but to help your creative control, you can release them and re-compose.

## How many pages per Recipe

You probably want to be consistent about this; decide on 1 or 2 pages (landscape), and spread the content out and even take a whole spread for the introduction.

### Page Numbers

Add page numbers in the parent pages. They can be centred or aligned left or right.

## Margins

Change the margins from the existing template. You are not obliged to keep the margin settings. **You must not change the page size.**
