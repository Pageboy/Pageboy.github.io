Some issues that you might encounter:

- If you have used a background image on your web site, this will show up in the initial saved document from Google Chrome. This will not show up in InDesign when you place the Word file.
- You may have some missing fonts if you used fancy ways on the web site to add typefaces - through Google fonts for example.
- large images are not displaying and text is overset.

The last issue here can be identified by viewing the text with Story Editor.

To solve the problem we can search for the graphic objects and apply an existing object style (one exists in the template but you can create one also).

## Images are embedded

When you place the Word documents into InDesign the images will be embedded and we need to _un-embed_ them. 

You will find the links panel under Window>Links. The images will need to be saved somewhere in your project space. Here are the steps to take.

Right-click over the image in the links panel.
