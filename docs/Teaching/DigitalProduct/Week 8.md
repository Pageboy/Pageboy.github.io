Some issues that you might encounter:

- If you have used a background image on your web site, this will show up in the initial saved document from Google Chrome. This will not show up in InDesign when you place the Word file.
- You may have some missing fonts if you used fancy ways on the web site to add typefaces - through Google fonts for example.
- large images are not displaying and text is overset.

The last issue here can be identified by viewing the text with Story Editor.

To solve the problem we can search for the graphic objects and apply an existing object style (one exists in the template but you can create one also).
