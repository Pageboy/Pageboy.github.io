We are now taking the contents from the web site that we have now completed and creating an enhanced eBook.

There are more than one ways to extract our content but by far the easier is to save each page ina format that can be _placed_ into InDesign

## Use Google Chrome
The Google chrome browser provides the ability to save each web page as a compatible HTML document with the extension `mhtml`. This file can be opened in MS Word.

### Getting the Content
- create a project folder with a sub folder called assets
- Open your web site and navigate to one of the recipes
- in the chrome browser go to `Save Page As`

![Save](../../media/Screenshot%202023-03-08%20at%2014.51.59.png)

- choose the `Webpage, Single File` format
- save this in the folder created above
- Open the file with MS Word and remove the menu section and spurious code
- Save as Word (.docx) in the folder above
- repeat for all recipes

### InDesign

- Open the provided template in InDesign
- place one of the recipe Word files into the first page
	- make sure to use the existing styles

- with this one recipe change styles and layout as you prefer
> [!important] 
> only use the existing paragraph and character styles if possible


- You need to un-embed the images from the links panel  and save in a folder within your project folder

![Make sure to select No](../../media/Screenshot%202023-03-10%20at%2013.32.01.png)

- spend more time with this one recipe and then
- add more recipes from the Word files

#### Prelim Pages
We need to add some pages at the beginning of the document.
Add page for introduction text
Create a table of contents
