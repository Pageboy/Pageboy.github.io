I will be remote for this week since I have Covid

The focus of this session is making sure that the site that is delivered is responsive and should be usable on a mobile phone.

We will look at the CSS and how to use the Flex object to automatically reorganise content when on a smaller device. We also use `media-queries` to make changes to the styles at certain device widths.


> [!NOTE] The system is already setup to make the web site into a _simulated_ web app for your phone
> You can also change the icon by going to this web site and replacing the icons folder on GitHub
>The template we are using already has a favicon but you can update this to [yours by going to this icon generator here](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and generating the various versions. You will need to replace the ones in the **icons** folder through GitHub.

You can check this document and look at the CodePen
