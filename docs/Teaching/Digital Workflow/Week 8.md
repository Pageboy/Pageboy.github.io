**Check InDesign version**

Re download the folder from moodle

## Getting XML of the play into InDesign

**find** the template *play.indt* from the downloaded resources

- Start a new InDesign file by opening this file (double click)
- Save as your play
- See the structure panel on the left

**Look at the DTD**

![Here is the DTD](../../../media/Screenshot%202022-11-16%20at%2016.42.33.png)

**Look at the tags pane**

![Tags Pane](../../../media/Screenshot%202022-11-16%20at%2016.47.40.png)

These tags match the style names (paragraph and character names)

### Import XML

From the context menu find _import XML_
Find your play from the folder _text_of_plays_
Import

Now see the play in the structure pane

![Structure](../../../media/Screenshot%202022-11-16%20at%2016.44.51.png)

### Put the XML on the page

- Drag the dramatis personae onto the first page
- Now drag the play onto the third page

#### map the tags with the styles

From the context menu on the structure pane see the menu item _Map tags to Styles_

> [!caution] 
>  Do not use the reverse of this

**Map by name**

![map by Name](../../../media/Screenshot%202022-11-16%20at%2017.03.11.png)

> [!hint] 
>  We will get a blank extra page at the beginning. This is because the style for the Dramatis heading is designed to start on a new page and there is already an empty paragraph on the first page. Just find the *pilchrow* on page one and delete this.

## After the Import has succeeded

- Turn off the Structure and tag markers

- The text is highly coloured just to indicate how the styles are attached
- Change the styles, change the typefaces.....
- Use styles that will be consistent with the Introduction part of the book (this can be changed after comments from this first assignment)
- focus on the style changes for the text
