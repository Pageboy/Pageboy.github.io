## Don't forget:

- check page numbering
- make your _Introduction_ the style source
- make new table of contents

### The Start of the Play

You will need a page that starts the play before the Dramatis Personae.This will need an item in the table of contents - here is how:

1. On that page you will need the title of your play showing decoratively (maybe like the title page)
2. then you will need, on the same page, the play title simply as well in a style that you define.
3. import this style into the introduction ( because this is the style source in the book panel)
4. modify the TOC to include this style (level 1)
5. now go back to the play-start page and hide the simple title under a white rectangle.

### More to check

- Check synchronising options
- [Preflight and Package for Print and Output to PDF](../../Articles/Preflight%20and%20Package%20for%20Print%20and%20Output%20to%20PDF.md)
- include _instructions_ to printer
- be very careful in the way that you count the pages and add blanks at the end if required.
