## Am I ready to submit my magazine for assignment 1?

### Check list

- add page numbers through the parent pages but not on the cover
- Download the Preflight profile from Moodle
- Use this profile for checking
- Make sure that:
	- All images are using the CMYK Colour space
	- Or greyscale if they are black and white
	- Images are in a minimum of 250dpi (can be more)
	- Images are not distorted (resolution will show as 2 numbers)
- Check that there is no overset text
- Make sure that you have a bleed of 3mm all round and that images that you want to bleed off the page are set out to that bleed line
- Check that you do not have any text too near to the edge of the page
- Make sure that you do not have any empty paragraphs; these will show as a pilchrow if you have *hidden characters on*

## Create the package

- Create a PDF  preset
- Choose File>Package
- Use crop marks only and spreads
- choose the PDF preset just made
- Find the folder just made and compress this folder
- Submit the zip file on Moodle
