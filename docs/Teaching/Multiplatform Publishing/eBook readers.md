The best alternative reader (for all platforms) is [Thorium available for free here](https://www.edrlab.org/software/thorium-reader/).

Adobe have also [Digital Editions which can be downloaded here](https://www.adobe.com/uk/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html).
The engine that drive Adobe Digital Editions is also used on various tablets such as Kobo and other Android based devices.

Aldiko (iOS and Android)
