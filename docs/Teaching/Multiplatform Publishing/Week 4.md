For this week we are looking at more details in how to style the play.

I make this Codepen here for you to explore and try to figure out what is happening.

>I have added 3 things to the HTML that have not been delivered from _InDesign_:

- The title of the play above the Dramatis personae like this:
```html
<header>
	<h1>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h1>
</header>
```
- I have wrapped all content (apart from the `nav` element) in a `main` box. This gives me more control over the overall display.
- I have added another `<li>` item for the link to the `Home page` like this:
```html
<li class="home TOC-Heading-1">
	<a href="index.html">Home</a>
</li>
```
