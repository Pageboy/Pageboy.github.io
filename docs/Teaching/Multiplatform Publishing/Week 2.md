## Get account On GitHub
* create an account on GitHub with a username that will be part of your web site address
* if your username (account owner) is _goodpublisher_ then your web site url would be `goodpublisher.github.io` Lets continue to use this example
* remember the email and password that you use
* while logged in go to another browser tab and open this repository (template):
	* `https://github.com/publisha/shakespeareplay`
* click the green button - use this template
* a new repository will be created for you but you now need to name this repository
* it is important that you name the repository with the URL that will work ie:
	* it must be named as above `goodpublisher.github.io`
* The web site will actually be delivered from the `docs` folder

Home page needs the play synopsis or how about using openAI to generate a plot summary?

Now read this:

[Using a Git Repository to host your Shakespeare Play Web Site](../../Web%20Sites%20with%20GitHub/Using%20a%20Git%20Repository%20to%20host%20your%20Shakespeare%20Play%20Web%20Site.md)

## Getting GitHub up and running

Go to Github.com and create an account
- your username is important because this becomes part of the web site URL
- mine is *chrisatbrookes*

Once signed in to Github go here:
 
[Go to this template](https://github.com/publisha/shakespeareplay)

You will need to use these commands in the **terminal** window:

git config --global user.name "your username"
git config --global user.email "email@address"
