## Get account On GitHub
* create an account on GitHub with a username that will be part of your web site address
* if your username (account owner) is _goodpublisher_ then your web site url would be `goodpublisher.github.io` Lets continue to use this example
* remember the email and password that you use
* while logged in go to another browser tab and open this repository (template):
	* `https://github.com/publisha/shakespeareplay`
* click the green button - use this template
* a new repository will be created for you but you now need to name this repository
* it is important that you name the repository with the URL that will work ie:
	* it must be named as above `goodpublisher.github.io`
* The web site will actually be delivered from the `docs` folder

Home page needs the play synopsis or how about using openAI to generate a plot summary?
