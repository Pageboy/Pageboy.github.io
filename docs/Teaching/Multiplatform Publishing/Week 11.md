# Week 11
## Enhancing the fixed layout eBook
>Note: Apple have a document which [covers a lot of this here](https://help.apple.com/itc/booksassetguide).

>[This document (over at publisha.org)](https://www.publisha.org/pages/enhanced_eBook/) does cover  a lot of these features although it does cover the reflowable eBook as well.

## Audio
- ambient
- music
- effects
- narration

Music will only play on the page where invoked unless special additions are made for Apple Books. In other words, music stops on leaving the page.

### Controlling the audio
Default audio controller can be used and if made wide, then it will be comprehensive with volume control as well.

Buttons are a good option if you want to simply provide a start and stop (actually pause) button.

### Ambient sound
By default, audio will stop when the page is changed, however, for Apple Books it is possible to use special code to get the sound to continue playing.
