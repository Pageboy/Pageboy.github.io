# Week 6
## eBook intro

### Steps

> All depends on how much you changed the play file  

* Go back to the print version with book panel
	* but if you added images in the play then you may need to use that version
	* if you only added the images in the HTML version, then you still have this extra work to do in InDesign
* We do need 6 images in the play
* We will use the `Articles` panel again
* The TOC does not need to be included but must be in the intro as before from the print version
* we will leave the on-page version out in the articles panel

Note, you can go right back to the original book panel with the 2 files or use the new play if you added the 6 images in there.

### What presentation?

There is a longer one on Moodle - watch at your leisure

eBook Typography from iCloud Ukraine

* Then demonstrate Dream play
* From book panel
* Articles additions
* Export options
* Export tagging
* Toc on page in intro do not export

Remember to add in the CSS file I made available on moodle

All images must be anchored and use the object style _scene-image_
The export tagging for this must create a figure
Style source is the intro so any changes must be included in that file (use load all text styles but also the object styles)
Check the table of contents

The first version will be rubbish so we need to go through the export tagging for the front matter.
