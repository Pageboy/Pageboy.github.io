# Week 10

## Enhancements to the eBook

Noting the marking criteria

> â€¦ enhancements added to the book to make a compelling interactive experience? Do the interactions and dynamic qualities add value to the eBook?

The more enhancements the better!

### Image enlargement with animation
Rather just have an image popup over the smaller view, large versions can arrive by fading or moving on to the page.

#### Extending the image with Effects

if the image that is to be enlarged does not cover the screen (if it is portrait), then we can extend the button area by using _effects_ and thenadding an _outer glow_. This will then cover over the other items on the screen but also extend the active button area so as to make the object hide on click/touch.

### Image sequences / slide show
We need to first create a range of images (preferably the same size), then an empty frame that will have a fitting setting that will fit proportionally. Then  duplicate the number of times needed. Then place multiple objects...

We can create a _multi-state object_ and then cycle through the images using an overlaid button.
