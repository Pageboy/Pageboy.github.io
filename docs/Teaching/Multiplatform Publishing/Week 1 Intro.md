![!Here is the plan for assignment 1](ass1plan%201.jpg)


- Install vscode

[https://code.visualstudio.com/download]()

* Put the vscode icon on the dock

### extensions for vscode:

* Liveserver
* Prettier
* GitHub Pull

Prettier not needed

We will download the folder from moodle or from ![here](docs/media/homepage.zip) here


## Next Steps.

* create an account on GitHub with a username that will be part of your web site address
* if your username (account owner) is _goodpublisher_ then your web site url would be `goodpublisher.github.io` Lets continue to use this example
* remember the email and password that you use
* while logged in go to another browser tab and open this repository (template):
	* `https://github.com/publisha/shakespeareplay`
* click the green button - use this template
* a new repository will be created for you but you now need to name this repository
* it is important that you name the repository with the URL that will work ie:
	* it must be named as above `goodpublisher.github.io`
* The web site will actually be delivered from the `docs` folder

Home page needs the play synopsis or how about using openAI to generate a plot summary?
