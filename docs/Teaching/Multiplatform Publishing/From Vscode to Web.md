Save the complete offline version your repository somewhere.

Edit the site within the docs folder.... do NOT change the structure of these pages.

## Providing your details
You will need to give your github username and email to vscode by using the terminal (can be within vscode or in the Terminal application)

```git
git config --global user.name "your username"
git config --global user.email "email@address"
```

## In Vscode

Any changes will be indicated as a number in the Source Control icon.
Write a short commit message and then use Sync Changes

>The live site will change
>But can take a while

For that reason best to work offline and check results locally first.
