Osney Bridge

When the previous bridge fell apart 140 years ago, pedestrians, cyclists and drivers of horse-drawn wagons faced a diversion for three years.

A man and a young girl were rescued after being thrown into the water during the collapse, but another girl drowned.

Cracks appeared in the road on the north side of the bridge on the morning of December 2, 1885 and gradually increased.

Rebuilding work finally began and the bridge reopened on December 22, 1888. The bill was said to be £4,500, although that probably didn’t include the cost of litigation, the temporary bridge and the constant replacement of barriers.
