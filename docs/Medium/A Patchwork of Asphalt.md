# A Patchwork of Asphalt
## Shades of grey at your feet

We recently had an electrical fault in our street and this meant that the supplier needed to excavate down to the cable right outside our house. Thankfully all was repaired and the hole was filled in and new asphalt was a spread over the patch. The result was good with a clean rectangle of fresh asphalt. You can see in the photo below how black this is in comparison to the older regions.

I spend a lot of time walking around our neighbourhood streets and do a goof deal of cycling. I have come to notice how roads and pavements  communicate a timeline of roadworks. 

## Underground

There are so many services present under our pavements. Gas, electric, water and more recently cable services. Occasionally they need to be reached by digging through the asphalt and laying a patch after the job is complete. I do  hope that plans exist to register where these services run.
